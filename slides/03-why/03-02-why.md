## Why to use functional programming? 

- programs keep increasing complexity. 
- we need more expressive code.
- we need easier code to reason about, debug and understand.

But remember that

> Functional programming isn’t the goal, the goal is to simplify complexity.

Note: 

The only way we’ll be able to keep up with the exponentially increasing complexity will be to decrease the complexity of understanding programs. 

To maintain the goliath apps of tomorrow, we must learn to build more expressive code.
