- programs keep increasing complexity. 
- we need more expressive code.
- we need easier code to reason about, debug and understand.
 

Note: 
The only way weâ€™ll be able to keep up with the exponentially increasing complexity will be to decrease the complexity of understanding programs. 

To maintain the goliath apps of tomorrow, we must learn to build more expressive code. 

We must learn to write programs that are easier to reason about, debug, create, analyze, and understand.
