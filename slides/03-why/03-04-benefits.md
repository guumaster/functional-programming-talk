## Benefits

 - Write less code
 - Fewer errors 
 - Better Testability
 - Better Readability
 - Favors Concurrency

Note: 
 
 *more on this later* 
 
- FP languages emphasise immutability, which has enormous benefits for concurrent applications than need to run effectively on multiple cores.

- the raise of multi-core processor asks for concurrency. And functional languages are good at it.
