> **Imperative programming** is telling explicitly to the system **how** to do something step by step. 


Note: 

- Imperative programming uses statements that change a program's state.

- We are used to the imperative paradigm. 
- It's what all of us have been taught while learning to code
- is the reason why this style is still dominant in modern programming languages. 
- software become more complex, we need to write safe, understandable and scalable code
