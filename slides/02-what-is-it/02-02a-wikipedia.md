## From Wikipedia

> Is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and **avoids changing-state and mutable data**.  It is a **declarative programming style**, which means programming is done with expressions, in contrast with **imperative programming style**, which emphasizes changes in state and the execution of sequential commands. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
