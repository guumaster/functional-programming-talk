    - **First Class functions**: Functions as values that can be stored, passed as arguments and created/returned  from functions.

    - **Higher Order Functions**:  Functions that can accept functions as arguments and/or return a function.

    - **No Side Effects**: Function that does something other than returning a value.

    - **Pure functions**: Functions that has no side effects.

    - **Referential Transparency**: For a given sets of arguments, the same code should always output the same value, only by changing arguments can an output value be different.

    - **Immutability**: Inability for variables to change their value once created. All things created stay constant.

    - **Currying / Partial Application**: Ability of a function to return a new function until it receives all itâ€™s arguments Calling a curried function only some of its arguments is called partial application.

    - **Recursion**: Iteration in functional languages is usually accomplished via recursion. Recursive functions invoke themselves, allowing an operation to be performed over and over until the base case is reached.

    - **Tail Call Optimization**: Ability to avoid allocation a new stack frame for a function call. Most commonly is a tail-recursion, where a recursive function uses constant stack space
