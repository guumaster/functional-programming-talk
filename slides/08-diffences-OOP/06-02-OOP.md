#### Object Oriented programming

 * Data and the operations upon it are tightly coupled.
 * An object owns its data and it owns the implementation of the operations on the data. 
 * Hides operations from other objects via its interfaces. 
 * **The central activity is composing new objects and extending existing objects with new methods**.
