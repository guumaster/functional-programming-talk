## What is it? Why use it?

## Definitions

There are multiple points of views of what functional programming is. Lets see some definitions.

--
## From Wikipedia

> Is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and **avoids changing-state and mutable data**.  It is a **declarative programming style**, which means programming is done with expressions, in contrast with **imperative programming style**, which emphasizes changes in state and the execution of sequential commands. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

--
## From the internets

> Functional programming **emphasizes the use functions**. Its main purpose is to abstract control flow and operations on data with functions in order to avoid side effects and reduce mutation of state in your code.

--
## From Uncle Bob

> Functional programming is programming without assignment statements. [Uncle Bob]

Note:
â€‹
Assign statement
- Introduces concept of time
- Separate the code before and after in time
- If there is no assignment statement, no variable change state, and there is no side effects

--
## Simple definition

> A combination of techniques that - when used together - allows you to limit state changes to as few places as possible and make them explicit.

> *"Functional"* is a way of thinking, more than a tool set.
