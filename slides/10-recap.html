## Revisiting FP benefits

Functions
- small functions are simpler, more maintainable <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- composition makes more readable and fluent APIs <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- function composition allow smaller and reusable building blocks <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->

Testability
- functional style code and pure functions are easier to test and reason about than stateful and imperative code <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->

Optimizations
- relying in language construct allows internal optimizations, parallelization, lazy evaluation <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- pure functions have referential transparency, allowing cache heavy computations (memoization) <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->

Side effects
- side effects couple with time, or questions about "what's the state" <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- avoid it by decomposing functions with side effects into pure functions and smaller functions with side effects <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- repeat this process to push side effects to the outer layer of your programs <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->

## Revisiting FP benefits

Immutability
- Mutable state + parallel processing = non-determinism <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- purely functional languages avoid race conditions because they don't have mutable variables <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- Imperative code tends to have mutable state, and is more vulnerable to race conditions <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->

Elegance
- There is a subset of very important conceptsâ€”borrowed from mathematics that form the backbone of all functional programming. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- More declarative. Write less code and focus more on **what** to do and less on **how** to do it. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
