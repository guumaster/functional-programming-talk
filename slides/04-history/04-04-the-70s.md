#### The 70s: establishing fundamental paradigms

* 1970 – Pascal
* 1971 - sh
* 1972 – C
* 1972 – Smalltalk
* 1972 – Prolog
* 1973 – ML
* 1975 – Scheme
* 1978 – SQL

> The period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period.

Note: 

 * Unix/C 
   - widespread usage of "function syntax" to denote procedural semantics.
 * ML (Meta Language) by Milner 
   - implemented in LISP ( to proof theorem)
   - combines pattern matching and recursion
   -  polymorphic type system
 * Scheme by Steele and Sussman
   - a LISP interpreter 
   - tail-call optimization
   - strong support for recursive algorithms
   - support first-class continuations
   - almost got implemented by Netscape in the browser
  * John Backus Turing Award and lecture 
    - "Can Programming Be Liberated From the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and its Algebra of Programs"
    - mentions "combining forms" that allow an "algebra of programs"
    - popularized research into functional programming
  * time for debate over the merits of "structured programming", programming without the use of GOTO.
