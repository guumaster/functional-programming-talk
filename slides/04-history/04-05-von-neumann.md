#### Von Neumann style (?)

A presentation by John Backus in the late 1970s "Can Programming Be Liberated From the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and its Algebra of Programs"
 
 
Note:
 * mentions "combining forms" that allow an "algebra of programs"
 * the paper popularized research into functional programming
 * though it emphasized function-level programming rather than the lambda-calculus style which has come to be associated with functional programming.
