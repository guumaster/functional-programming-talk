#### Up to the 60s: First programming languages

* 1956 – FORTRAN (First compiler)
* 1958 – LISP
* 1958 – ALGOL
* 1959 – COBOL
* 1964 – Simula
* 1964 – BASIC
* 1968 – Logo

> In the 40s, the limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand tuned assembly language programs. Programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort and was error-prone.
> The 50s brought the firts high level languages.

Note:
 * Fortran 
   - first widely used programming language. By Jhon Backus
 * LISP (multiparadigm) by John McCarthy
