#### The 80s: Modularization and performance

Consolidation, modules, performance. Winning of imperative languages.

* 1980 – C++ (C with classes)
* 1984 – Common Lisp
* 1985 - Miranda
* 1986 – Objective-C
* 1986 – Erlang
* 1987 – Perl
* 1987 - Caml

> The 80s were the years of relative consolidation in imperative languages. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all elaborated upon the ideas previously invented. Also brought advances in programming language implementation. 

Note: 
  * 70s & 80s: More functional languages created at universities from different research 
  * Miranda 
    - Lazy evaluation, pure functional
  * Erlang 
    - desirable features of Lisp and Prolog but with concurrency and error recovery built-in
  * Constructs used by FP languages performed worse than their imperative counterparts. 
  * In a time when CPU power was scarce, imperative counterparts won.
