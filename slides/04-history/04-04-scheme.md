#### Scheme 

Scheme was developed as a LISP interpreter by Steele and Sussman during the 1970s.

Note:

 * first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization
 * stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms
 * one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations
 * almost got implemented by Netscape in the browser
