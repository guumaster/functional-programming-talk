## An FP common pattern

List processing is a fundamental characteristic of functional programming

- from some condition create a list of things
- transform a list of things in a list of another things
- reduce a list of things to a single value

- to process a list:
    - transform the head of list
    - recursively call itself with the rest of the list
    - and stop at end or when some base conditions are met
