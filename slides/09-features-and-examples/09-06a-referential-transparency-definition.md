#### Referential transparency

> For a given sets of arguments, the same code should always output the same value, only by changing arguments can an output value be different.

Note: 

 - you can determine the result of applying that function only by looking at the values of its arguments
 - is a more formal way of defining a pure function.
 - Purity in this sense refers to the existence of a pure mapping between a functionâ€™s arguments and its return value.
 - a function that always yields the same result on the same input, it is said to be referentially transparent.
 - you can replace any expression with the result of evaluating that expression without changing the meaning of the program.
