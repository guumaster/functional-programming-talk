#### Immutability

> Inability for variables to change their value once created. All things created stay constant.

Note: 

 - Immutable data structures ensure that your code wonâ€™t have side effects.
 - Use persistent data structures
 - linked lists you can create different heads and modify objects but don't destroy previous version. Like git for data structures
