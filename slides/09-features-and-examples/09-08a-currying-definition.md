#### Currying

> Ability of a function to take one argument and return a new function until it receives all it’s arguments.

Note: 

 * Converts a multivariable function into a step-wise sequence of unary functions.

 * Higher-order functions enable currying,

 * a function is applied to its arguments one at a time,  with each application returning a new (higher-order) function that accepts the next argument.

 * Haskell Curry, who rediscovered a technique devised by another mathematician named Moses Schönfinkel.
