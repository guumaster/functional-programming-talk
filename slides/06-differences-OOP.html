## Differences with OOP

--
#### Object Oriented programming

* Data and the operations upon it are tightly coupled.
* An object owns its data and it owns the implementation of the operations on the data.
* Hides operations from other objects via its interfaces.
* **The central activity is composing new objects and extending existing objects with new methods**.

--
#### Functional programming

* Data is only loosely coupled to functions.
* You can write different operations on the same data structure
* The central model for abstraction is the function, not the data structure.
* Functions hide their implementation
* **Central activity in FP is writing new functions**.

#### Simple put

> -- OOP makes code understandable by **encapsulating moving parts**
> -- FP makes code understandable by **minimizing moving parts**

## They can co-exists

- Same levels of expressiveness. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- Similar abilities to encapsulate programs into smaller parts. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- Parts that can be combined and recombined. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- The main difference is the relationship between data and operations on the data. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- OOP excels at composing data. FP excels at composing logic. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- JavaScript is as functional as it is object-oriented; and both are useful for implementing applications. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- Functional programming and object-oriented programming are not mutually exclusive and can be used simultaneously. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->

Note:

- JavaScript allows a variety of different programming paradigms:
    * OO / functional / procedural

- Is not a *pure* functional programming language, but it allows us to program in a functional way
- You can use both, OO and FP, in a mixed paradigm. Just try not to change state, use immutable objects
