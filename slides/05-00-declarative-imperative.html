## Declarative vs Imperative

--

## Imperative

> **Imperative programming** is telling explicitly to the system **how** to do something step by step.

Note:

- Imperative programming uses statements that change a program's state.

- We are used to the imperative paradigm.
- It's what all of us have been taught while learning to code
- is the reason why this style is still dominant in modern programming languages.
- software become more complex, we need to write safe, understandable and scalable code

## Declarative

> **Declarative programming** is telling the system **what** you would like to happen, without instructing it how to do it.


Note:

- Declarative programming
    - an umbrella term that includes a number of better-known programming paradigms.
    - discourages usage of variables in favor of function composition or pipelines.
    - It has a more clear correspondence to mathematical logic.

#### The *troll* version

> Declarative programming is describing a problem like a mathematician. Imperative programming is like giving instructions to an idiot. - *a Scheme programmer*
