## Why to use functional programming?

- programs keep increasing complexity. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- we need more expressive code. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- we need easier code to reason about, debug and understand. <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->

## But remember that

> Functional programming isn’t the goal, the goal is to simplify complexity.

Note:

The only way we’ll be able to keep up with the exponentially increasing complexity will be to decrease the complexity of understanding programs.

To maintain the goliath apps of tomorrow, we must learn to build more expressive code.

Moore's law may be ending

Note:

- Speed of clock rate processor can't coup
- Transistors will top soon too. (20nanometers)
- Solution: add more cores
- functional is safer, but is more memory heavy. In the beginning memory was expensive, but is getting cheaper.

### Benefits

- Write less code <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- Fewer errors <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- Better Testability <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- Better Readability <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->
- Favors Concurrency <!-- .element: class="fragment slide" -->

Note:

*more on this later*

- FP languages emphasise immutability, which has enormous benefits for concurrent applications than need to run effectively on multiple cores.

- the raise of multi-core processor asks for concurrency. And functional languages are good at it.
